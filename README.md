 # Project_1 : Is Daylight Savings Time a Killer?

## Hypothesis
   
   Does participating in daylight savings time lead to Californians being seriously injured or dying?
    
     Some of the topics we will be exploring:  
     
       How does changing our clocks for Daylight Savings Time in the Spring and Fall effect California's accident rates 
       and severity of accident? 
            
       Is when Daylight Savings Time changes, Spring vs. Fall make a difference? 
       
       How does California numbers compare to Arizona? AZ was chosen as a control group due to it's non-participation in
       DST and it is the closest to CA's topography and weather. (There are only two states that do not participate in DST;
       They are Arizona and Hawaii.)
