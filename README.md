 # Project_1 : Is Daylight Savings Time a Killer?

## Hypothesis
   
   Does participating in daylight savings time lead to Californians' being seriously injured or dying?
    
     Some of the topics we will be exploring:  
     
       How does changing our clocks for Daylight Savings time in the Spring and Fall 
       effectCalifornia's accident rates and severity of accident? 
       
       Is when Daylight Savings Time changes, Spring vs. Fall make a difference? 
       
       How does California numbers compare to Arizonia? AZ was chosen as a control group due to  
       it's non-participation in DST and it is the closest to CA's topography and weather. (There are only
       two states that do not participate in DST; They are Arizona and Hawaii.)
